✅ User Authentication - Secure login & registration system.\
✅ Home Feed - View the latest posts from users.\
✅ Like & Save Posts - Engage with content by liking and saving posts.\
✅ Explore Section - Discover posts filtered by time (e.g., last day, last month).\
✅ Follow System - Follow/unfollow users and view their profiles.\
✅ Post Creation - Users can create and share their own posts.\
✅ Custom Routing & Session Handling - Built-in router and authentication system.\
✅ Tailwind CSS - Clean and responsive UI design.

This project is a great demonstration of raw PHP development, structuring an MVC-based application manually while maintaining scalability and efficiency. 🚀
